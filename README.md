# AI-Powered Retail Media Creative Builder

## Project Description
Retail media advertising is growing rapidly, but creating high-quality, platform-compliant creatives is still slow, costly, and dependent on designers or agencies. Small and medium advertisers struggle with maintaining brand consistency, following retailer guidelines, and resizing creatives for multiple platforms.

The **AI-Powered Retail Media Creative Builder** solves this problem by using Generative AI to automatically create professional, brand-consistent, and retailer-compliant marketing creatives without requiring design expertise. The platform reduces creative turnaround time, lowers costs, and improves creative quality across channels.

## Objective
- Enable non-designers to create professional retail ad creatives  
- Automate creative generation, resizing, and compliance checks  
- Ensure brand consistency across multiple platforms  
- Reduce dependency on agencies and manual design effort

## Solution Overview
The project is a web-based visual creative builder where users upload product images and brand assets, select campaign goals, and generate multiple AI-powered creative variations. The system automatically removes backgrounds, suggests layouts and copy, resizes creatives for multiple platforms, validates compliance, and exports ready-to-use assets.
